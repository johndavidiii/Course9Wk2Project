- The Web page should have an interactive map that has been created by Leaflet
```{r echo = TRUE}
library(leaflet)
set.seed(2016-04-25)

df <- data.frame(lat = runif(500, min = 45.25, max = 46.25),
                 lng = runif(500,min = -108.95, max = -107.95))

```

```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#library(leaflet)
d <- Sys.Date()
d1 <- sprintf("Today's Date is %s",d)
myMap <- df %>% 
  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions())

```
## My Map
```{r, comment="", message=FALSE}
